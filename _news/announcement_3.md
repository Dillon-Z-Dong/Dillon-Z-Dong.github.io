After being featured in press releases by <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/a-black-hole-triggers-a-premature-supernova" target="blank">Caltech</a>, <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/news/stellar-collision-triggers-supernova/" target="blank">NRAO</a> and the Science press package, my paper received a whirlwind of press coverage: articles in 18+ languages and 40+ countries! Here are some of my favorites: a really well-written article by Adam Mann for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-star-swallow-black-hole-supernova-cosmology" target="blank">Science News</a>, a short and sweet summary in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02395-9" target="blank">Nature Research Highlights</a>, and a French article in <a href="https://www.futura-sciences.com/sciences/actualites/univers-etoile-explose-supernova-avalant-etoile-neutrons-trou-noir-51693/" target="blank">Futura Sciences</a> where the author went out of his way to introduce the full context of binary interaction with compact objects, including a discussion of Thorne Zytkow objects!

I wrote a transient discovery pipeline that (1) catalogs millions of sources in the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS): the largest high-resolution radio sky survey to date, (2) automatically rejects common image artifacts classes, and (3) measures the brightness of each source and estimates the probability that it has changed in brightness relative to previous radio observations of the same field. This process has led to the discovery of thousands of new radio transients, which will be published and released in upcoming survey papers planned for 2022.

    VLASS is observing the full northern sky 3 times over 7 years at a resolution of ~2 arcseconds and an RMS noise of 0.14 mJy / beam. It is split up into half-epochs. The green area has already been observed twice (Epochs 1.1 and 2.1), and the blue area has been observed once (Epoch 1.2) and is currently being observed for the 2nd time (Epoch 2.2).
